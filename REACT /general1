Simple react component which is returning a react element 

const App=()=>{
    return(
        <div>
            <h1>App Component</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

console.log(App());

but for react it is returning a object 
The JSX gets converted to React.createElement function calls 

const buttonClick = ()=>{
    const handleClick=()=>{
        onslotchange.log("Button Clicked")
    };

    return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me!</button>
};

JSX-> 
1. handles Events
2. JSX helps you use other react component as if they are HTML elements 


Describe React components and the differences between functional and class components.

-> building blocks of user interface 
-> helps in reusing components 
-> break UI into smaller less complex components 

Functional components 
 FC dont have access to lifecycle methods 
 generally lightweight and have better performance 
 react hooks 
import React from 'react';
const MyApp=(props)=>{
    return(
        <div>
        {props.message}
        </div>
    )
};
export default MyApp;


Class components
import React from 'react';

class MyApp extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return (
            <div>
                {this.props.message}
            </div>
        )
     }
};
export default MyApp
